                    Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works. You can freely use, modify,
 and redistribute the software, but any derivative works must
 also be free and open.

 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that ensure
 that everyone else also has these freedoms. For example, if you
 distribute copies or modified versions of the software, you must
 pass on the same freedoms to others. That way, every user has
 the same rights.
